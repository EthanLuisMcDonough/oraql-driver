Running problem size 15\^3 per domain until completion
Num processors: \d+
Num threads: \d+
Total number of elements: 3375 

To run other sizes, use -s <integer>.
To run a fixed number of iterations, use -i <integer>.
To run a more or less balanced region set, use -b <integer>.
To change the relative costs of regions, use -c <integer>.
To print out progress, use -p
To write an output file for VisIt, use -v
